1. Copy the files in this repo, _except_ for a folder called `.github`.

   This folder contains all of your workflow files, so  you need to create one on your own!  

2. Create TWO workflows.
   - **First workflow** should contain `lint`, `test` and `deploy` steps. Feel free to divide them into three jobs if you'd like. They should run after one another.
   - **Second workflow** 
   
## My Solution
I started off creating the first workflow with three jobs, namely `lint`, `test` and `deploy`. I didn't think of creating the workflow in a single job, which in this case would make more sense.
